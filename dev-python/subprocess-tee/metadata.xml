		This package provides an drop-in alternative to subprocess.run that captures the output while still printing 
		it in real time, just the way tee does.

		Printing output in real-time while still capturing is important for any tool that executes long running child
		processes, as you may not want to deprive user from getting instant feedback related to what is happening.
