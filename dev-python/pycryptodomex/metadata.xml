		PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
		cryptographic primitives. It is a fork of PyCrypto, and brings
		numerous enhancements with respect to the official versions of
		PyCrypto, such as Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX,
		SIV, OCB), Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI, Elliptic
		curves cryptography (NIST P-256, P-384 and P-521 curves only),
		SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs), truncated SHA-512 and BLAKE2 hash
		algorithms, and many more. PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a
		separate C library like OpenSSL. To the largest possible extent,
		algorithms are implemented in pure Python. Only the pieces that
		are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers) are
		implemented as C extensions.
