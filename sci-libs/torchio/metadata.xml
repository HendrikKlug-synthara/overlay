        TorchIO is a Python package containing a set of tools to efficiently read,
        preprocess, sample, augment, and write 3D medical images in deep learning
        applications written in PyTorch, including intensity and spatial transforms
        for data augmentation and preprocessing. Transforms include typical computer
        vision operations such as random affine transformations and also
        domain-specific ones such as simulation of intensity artifacts due to MRI
        magnetic field inhomogeneity or k-space motion artifacts.
